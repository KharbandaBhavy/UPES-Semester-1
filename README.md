# UPES-Semester-1
This repository represents the beginning of my coding journey during my college.
During my first semester, we had several subjects and "Principles of Programming Language" is one of them. 
There are various basic C programs in this repository with their problem statements.
You can check out those programs for basic C knowledge.
Happy Coding 🧑🏻‍💻....
